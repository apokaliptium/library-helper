A Foundry-based template for developing Solidity smart contracts, with sensible defaults. Dependencies are managed as
Node.js packages via [Bun](https://bun.sh) rather than git submodules, and the template ships preconfigured with Forge
Std, OpenZeppelin Contracts, Prettier, and Solhint.

## What's Inside

- [Forge](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/blob/master/crates/forge): compile, test, fuzz, format, and deploy smart
  contracts
- [Forge Std](https://github.com/foundry-rs/forge-std): collection of helpful contracts and utilities for testing
- [Bun](https://bun.sh): manage Foundry dependencies as Node.js packages instead of git submodules
- [OpenZeppelin Contracts](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts): library of secure, community-vetted
  smart contracts (pre-installed)
- [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier): code formatter for non-Solidity files
- [Solhint](https://github.com/protofire/solhint): linter for Solidity code
